# Hi! üëãüèª I'm Michael

I'm a full stack web developer in Dallas, Texas.

I love tinkering with my homelab and self hosting. I'm also a music maker! You can find me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/02GoucpEZGrYUkz7PwkWXw) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ice-cream-loaf/1516175215).

I'm currently focused on building my dating app, [Comeet](https://joincomeet.com), to foster face to face interactions instead of initiating relationships through text. You can find more info on my Projects page [here](@/projects/_index.md#comeet).

I have experience with the .NET Framework, as well as some experience with Node.JS and Angular. Currently I'm developing my skills with Swift/SwiftUI.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:michael@rossjr.dev)!
