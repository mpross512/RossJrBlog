# Current Projects

## Comeet

Comeet is a custom dating app specifically for students at The University of Texas at Dallas. It tries to eliminate image-focused nature of dating apps, as well as the routine of users chatting and then never meeting up. Instead, it matches 5 users a week, and the users have the option to either accept or reject a date. Afterwards, the app picks a time and place for the pair to meet, and they show up and begin interacting, no texting involved.

## Local Good Center Inventory System

This project is a custom customer management system for a local food bank. Most software requires an email address for customers to check in and use the system, but the Local Good Center serves lots of clients who are from different countries and don't have access to an email address. Because of this, they needed a custom solution for customers to be able to sign in, set appointments, and check in, just using a phone number.

## GrowthSpurt

Growth Spurt is a hackathon project that aims to help people keep good habits. Users enter their habits on the site where they can give it a name and frequency, and then are given a virtual plant. In order to maintain the health of the plant, users have to confirm that they have done the action they specified for their habit for the day. If they succeed, the plant will thrive, and the user will be given additional plants to add to their greenhouse. If they are unsuccessful, however, their plant will die, and all the plants in their greenhouse will be removed.
