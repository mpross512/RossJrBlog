I've been tinkering around with self-hosting different services for a while on a Raspberry Pi, but after diving into the world of 4k DVDs and MakeMKV, I realized I was going to need a proper NAS solution to hold all my 30GB DVD rips.

## Would I recommend the N305?

Absolutely.

The N305 board from CWWK is awesome.

## Postmortem

There are probably a few things I would do differently in this build. Even though a smaller power supply isn't necessary in the case I purchased, I think it would've helped a lot with space and cable management. And speaking of cases, I think there are some better options I could've chosen.

## TLDR
