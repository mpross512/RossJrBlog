It tries to eliminate image-focused nature of dating apps, as well as the routine of users chatting and then never meeting up. Instead, it matches 5 users a week, and the users have the option to either accept or reject a date. Afterwards, the app picks a time and place for the pair to meet, and they show up and begin interacting, no texting involved.\n\nTechnologies\n\nSwift/SwiftUI\nSupabase\nXcode\n\nLocal Good Center Inventory System\nThis project is a custom customer management system for a local food bank.
